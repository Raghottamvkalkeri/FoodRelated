If a product order has already been placed and, during editing, the product is found to be out of inventory, should we provide a feature to delete the product from the order?
Can we just give the option to update the quatity rather than UOM? 
Because the is chance of ad same product with different UOMS on that time there must chances of changing UOMS then if may get confilict and add both as same UOMS
Do we need this in responsive as well?
Is there any chances of delete all the product from same order? If yes do we need to remove entire order?
